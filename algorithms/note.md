Algorithms

* Data processing within a finite amount of space and time
* Consider ' Big O'
* Big O, O(n): used to describe the performance of an algorithm
* Big O growth rates : O(1), O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), O(2^n)
* Calculations such as search, sort, sum
* Key points to consider: Depends on the input size, how Big O, Time, Space will respond? What data structure is most efficient?
